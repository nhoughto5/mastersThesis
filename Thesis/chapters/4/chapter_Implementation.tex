\section{Introduction}
The \Name was build to be a stand-alone application.
In order to allow it to be a powerful yet simple application the technologies used were selected with the idea of portability in mind.

\section{Technologies Used}
\subsection{\Xilinx}
\Xilinx is one of the two largest manufacturers of \acrshort{FPGA}s. 
Their devices are considerably more popular than their competitors.
The configuration of devices employs a well known series of steps referred to as the \Xilinx 'tool-chain'~\cite{xilnxDevManual}.
The 'tool-chain' not only compiles user designs and constraints into the configuration \gls{Bitstream} but performs a series of complex operations to optimize designs and effectively implement them on any \Xilinx model of the user's choosing.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{\gls{sch2hdl}}: \glsdesc{sch2hdl}
	\item \textbf{\gls{XST}}: \glsdesc{XST}
	\item \textbf{\gls{MAP}}: \glsdesc{MAP}
	\item \textbf{\gls{PAR}}: \glsdesc{PAR}
	\item \textbf{\gls{ngdbuild}}: \glsdesc{ngdbuild}
	\item \textbf{\gls{trce}}: \glsdesc{trce}
	\item \textbf{\gls{Bitgen}}: \glsdesc{Bitgen}
\end{enumerate}
Each step produces a series of files that are used for a variety of purposes. 
Often the resultant files are used by the subsequent step but some are intended for user information.
The \gls{ngdbuild} tool generates what is known as the netlist for the design.
The netlist is a description of the connectivity of the circuit implemented on the device. 
The generated netlist is in a non human-readable format in an 'ndc' file.
Fortunately, \Xilinx provides an additional tool called \acrshort{xdl2ndc} which allows the conversion to the human-readable \acrfull{XDL}.
\subsubsection{\acrfull{XDL}}
The \acrfull{XDL} is a human-readable ASCII format; though it is not actively part of the 'tool-chain' it is considered a native netlist format for describing and representing \acrshort{FPGA} designs~\cite{xdlTutorial}. 
A part is a human-defined component which is to be implemented.
Netlists either contain or refer to descriptions of the parts used and where in the device they are implemented.
When a part is used it is called an 'instance'; thus each 'instance' has a definition, sometimes referred to as a master.

An \acrshort{XDL} file contains two sections, the instance placement and configuration section, and the net routing section. 
The placement and configuration section provides a list of every instance in a design. 
Their descriptions include all of the configuration details required for their implementation on a component (power settings, logic, timing configurations... etc).
In the \Xilinx jargon, a net refers to any electrical path between two components; more specifically, a net describes a communication channel.
The gate-array of a \Xilinx device is composed of a grid of wires.
These wires can be fused together by \acrfull{PIP} to make a useful connection between two components, thus creating a net.
The output-pin of a net receives the signal from the transmitting component while the input-pin delivers the signal to the receiver.
The \acrshort{PIP}s in-between dictate the path the signal takes between the two components.
The net routing section of the \acrshort{XDL} file describes every path in the design.
Combined, these two sections completely describe a design and how it is implemented.
\subsubsection{XDLRC} \label{sec:XDLRC}
The \acrshort{XDL} file describes the design implemented on a device.
From this a lot of information regarding the composition of a \Xilinx device can be learned but it does not provide the entire description; only what has been used by the design.
The \acrshort{xdl2ndc} command line tool provides an option to generate a resource report file referred to as an XDLRC file. 
A XDLRC file describes the entire architecture of a \Xilinx \acrshort{FPGA}.

Listing~\ref{lst:xdlrc} provides and example of the XDLRC format.
The report begins with a header describing the device.
It then reports that the overall architecture contains a matrix of tiles 73-wide and 62-tall.
Further down we can see a configurable logic block at coordinate (4,6) and an interconnect tile at coordinate (4,5) are shown.
Each of these tile descriptions provide details of the subcomponents they contain, pinwires, \acrshort{PIP}s, slices...etc.
The tool is capable of generating a variety of different XDLRC files for a device, ranging in the level of detail.
The smaller files can range around 10MB while the fully detailed descriptions can reach 7GB.
\subsection{Java} \label{sec:java}
Java is a powerful and general-purpose programming language. 
It is specifically designed to be as independent as possible.
The original developer, James Gosling, intended the language to allow developers a comfortable implementation experience with seamless deployment. 
The custodians of the Java language, Sun Microsystems, promotes the slogan 'write-once, run anywhere'.  
\Name was written in Java primarily in order to interface with the \acrshort{API} known as RapidSmith which is described in section~\ref{sec:rapidSmith}.
However, the additional benefits of allowing \Name to be compact, cross-platform application can not be understated.
The Java language provides a native \acrfull{GUI} toolkit known as \Swing.
\Swing is an \acrshort{API} that is part of Oracle's Java Foundation Classes; in other words it is readily available to all users of Java.
It provides a simple to use programming structure for creating sophisticated \acrshort{UIs}.
\Name employs Java and Java \Swing to make it as user-friendly as possible. 

\subsection{RapidSmith} \label{sec:rapidSmith}
RapidSmith is a set of tools and \acrfull{APIs} written in Java that enable \acrfull{CAD} tool creation for \Xilinx \acrshort{FPGA}s~\cite{rapidSmith}.
Its purpose is to be used as a rapid prototyping platform for experimentation and research.
The code is freely to use readily accessible.
It was chosen as a supporting library for \Name for several reasons.
First, the code base provides a series of class structures that astutely mirrors structure of \Xilinx devices and infrastructure.
Secondly, it provides ready-made tools for extracting frames \gls{Bitstream} files. 
\gls{Bitstream} files are huge binary files, without the tools provided by RapidSmith the analysis of these files becomes an arduous task.
Finally, and most importantly, the creators of RapidSmith have developed a means of condensing XDLRC files into a greatly compressed format referred to as a 'database' file.
\Name requires considerable detail of an \acrshort{FPGA}'s architecture in order to accurately described the effects a trojan has on a design.
As mentioned in section~\ref{sec:XDLRC}, the fully detailed XDLRC files can reach 7GB in size.
Working with text-based files of this size determents performance to an unusable level.
