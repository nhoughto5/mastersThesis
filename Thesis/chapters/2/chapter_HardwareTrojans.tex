\section{Background} \label{sec:trojanBackGround}
\acrfull{ICs} are continuously decreasing in size whilst increasing in complexity.
These trends require ever more people and sophisticated means of manufacture which in turn creates security vulnerabilities.
Products developed by semiconductor companies generally compromised in one of two ways.
First, due to the complexity it is rare for a product to be managed within a single company.
Frequently, steps in the production-chain are outsourced.
It is within these 'third-party' contributors that products can be maliciously modified.
Secondly, for various reasons, employees of trusted contributors have been known to make modifications.~\cite{trojanSurvey2014}
These modifications are known as hardware Trojans.
\acrshort{IC}s are an integral part of every facet of the modern world.
Proper application of a Trojan can provide information, control of mechanical systems, surveillance and more to an unauthorized party.


\section{Topology} \label{sec:topology}
The discussion, detection and evaluation of hardware trojans requires a comprehensive means of description.
Several hardware trojan taxonomies have been proposed~\cite{taxonomy1, taxonomy2, taxonomy3, taxonomy4}.
In~\cite{taxonomy1}, trojans were organized based solely on their activation mechanisms.
A taxonomy based on the location, activation and action of a trojan was presented in \cite{taxonomy2}, \cite{taxonomy3}.
However, these approaches do not consider the manufacturing process.
Another taxonomy was proposed in~\cite{taxonomy4} which employs five categories: insertion, abstraction, activation, effect, and location.
While this is more extensive than previous approaches, it fails to account for the physical characteristics of a trojan.
An additional taxonomy was proposed in~\cite{samerAttribute} which considers all attributes a hardware trojan may posses.
This taxonomy is the most comprehensive and was selected as the means of description for this work.

	\caption{The thirty-three attributes of the hardware trojan taxonomy in~\cite{samerAttribute}.}
	\label{fig:HW_trojan}
\end{figure}
It is comprised of thirty-three attributes organized into eight categories as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:HW_trojan}.
These categories can be arranged into the following four levels as indicated in Fig.~\ref{fig:trojan_life_cycle}.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The \textbf{insertion} (chip life-cycle) level/category comprises the attributes pertaining to the IC production stages.
	\item The \textbf{abstraction} level/category corresponds to where in the IC abstraction the trojan is introduced.
	\item The \textbf{properties} level comprises the behavior and physical characteristics of the trojan.
	\item The \textbf{location} level/category corresponds to the location of the trojan in the IC.
\end{enumerate}
The properties level consists of the following categories.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The \textbf{effect} describes the disruption or effect a trojan has on the system.
	\item The \textbf{logic type} is the circuit logic that triggers the trojan, either combinational or sequential.
	\item The \textbf{functionality} differentiates between trojans which are functional or parametric.
	\item The \textbf{activation} differentiates between trojans which are always on or triggered.
	\item The \textbf{layout} is based on the physical characteristics of the trojan.
\end{itemize}

\end{table*}
The relationships between the trojan attributes shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:HW_trojan} can be described using a matrix $\mathbf{R}$~\cite{samerAttribute}.
%Systematic analysis of matrix $\mathbf{R}$ provides useful insight into the overall nature of a subject.
%A procedure used to develop the nature of a subject has been described in~\cite{samerAttribute} and is referred to as Classification.
Entry $r(i,j)$ in $\mathbf{R}$ indicates whether or not attribute $i$ can lead to attribute $j$.
For example, $r(2,3) = 1$ indicates that design (attribute 2) can lead to fabrication (attribute 3).
This implies that if an IC can be compromised during the design phase (attribute 2), it may influence the fabrication phase (attribute 3).

The matrix $\mathbf{R}$ is divided into sub matrices as follows
\[
\newcommand\scalemath[2]{\scalebox{#1}{\mbox{\ensuremath{\displaystyle #2}}}}
\mathbf{R} =\left[
\scalemath{1.1}{
	\begin{array}{l*{3}{c}}
	\mathbf{R_1} ~ & ~ \mathbf{R_{12}} ~ & ~ 0 ~  &  ~ 0   \\
	0         & \mathbf{R_2}      &\mathbf{R_{23}}       & ~ 0 \\
	0          & 0           & \mathbf{R_3}          & ~ \mathbf{R_{34}} \\
	0          & 0           & 0                & ~ \mathbf{R_4} \\
	\end{array}
}
\right]
\label{R}
\]
where $\mathbf{R_1}$, $\mathbf{R_2}$, $\mathbf{R_3}$ and $\mathbf{R_4}$ indicate the attribute relationships within a category.
For example, $\mathbf{R_1}$ is given by
\[
\newcommand\scalemath[2]{\scalebox{#1}{\mbox{\ensuremath{\displaystyle #2}}}}
\mathbf{R_1} =\left[
\scalemath{1.0}{
	\begin{array}{l|*{11}{c}}
	A & 1$~$ & 2$~$  & 3$~$ & 4$~$& 5$~$\\ \hline
	1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0  \\
	2 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0  \\
	3 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0  \\
	4 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1  \\
	5 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0  \\
	\end{array}
}
\right ]
\label{R1}
\]
Submatrix $\mathbf{R_{12}}$ relates the attributes of the insertion category to the attributes of the abstraction category.
An example of this submatrix is
\[
\newcommand\scalemath[2]{\scalebox{#1}{\mbox{\ensuremath{\displaystyle #2}}}}
\mathbf{R_{12}} =\left[
\scalemath{1.0}{
	\begin{array}{l|*{11}{c}}
	A & 6$~$  & 7$~$ & 8$~$ & 9$~$ & 10  & 11\\ \hline
	1  & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
	2  & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
	3  & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
	4  & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
	5  & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
	\end{array}

\section{Recent Work}
Hardware trojans are a new and exciting field of study.
As \acrshort{FPGA}s take a larger portion of the \acrfull{IC} market the need for security becomes greater.
With this, detection and analysis of trojans in \acrshort{FPGA}s has become a growing topic and has seen some development in recent years.
The majority of work focused on \acrshort{FPGA} trojans has employed either a means of reverse engineering, functional testing or 'side-channel' analysis.
The configuration \gls{Bitstream} contains all of the information one would want to know about what is happening on the device.
There has been little effort to directly analyze the \gls{Bitstream} because manufacturers are reluctant to provide intimate details of its format.
  
\subsection{\acrfull{CRC} Detection} \label{sec:crcDetection}
Because \acrshort{FPGA} design is done using a software language it is possible for designers to share component designs easily.
It is common for designers to employ 'third-party' \acrfull{IP}. 
This sharing of component design provides the opportunity for attackers to add trojans to commercial products by sharing trojan containing \acrshort{IP}.
In 2013 researchers at Cairo University proposed a method of insulating externally sourced \acrshort{IP} with \acrfull{CRC} defense modules~\cite{crcDetection}.
According to the authors their method is capable of detecting leaked information with a 99.95\% accuracy.
This method is only capable of detecting trojans that possess Effect attribute Information Leakage (13).
In addition they report considerable detriment to power consumption and performance.

\subsection{\acrfull{RO} Detection}
Researchers at the Technological Educational Institute of Western Greece and Industrial Systems Institute/RC “Athena” jointly proposed a method of using \acrfull{ROs} as a mechanism for detecting hardware trojans~\cite{ringOscillatorMethod}.
A \acrshort{RO} is a circuit composed of inverters formed into a loop.
Electric current looping through the \acrshort{RO} does so at an inherent frequency.
By configuring the circuit paths of the user's design into a \acrshort{RO} it is possible to create a 'signature'.
This signature is an expected frequency emitted from the \gls{golden} design. 
The authors claim that modifications to the design will alter the frequency emitted by its circular configuration.
The experimental results showed that modifications did in-fact alter the frequency enough to reliably detect modifications.
This method can reliably detect hardware trojans but is incapable of providing any details regarding its effect.
Further, the stipulation that the \gls{golden} must be such that it forms an oscillating ring is impractical.
It is impossible to guarantee that all real-world designs can form an \acrshort{RO} whilst maintaining desired functionality and performance.
\subsection{The Multi-Faceted Approach}
Researchers from Iowa State University proposed a multi-faceted approach to trojan detection in \acrshort{FPGA}s~\cite{multiFacetedApproach}.
Their method composed of three approaches:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Functional Testing: A means of feeding test vectors and comparing the output to expected results.
	\item Power Analysis: Using an oscilloscope, the difference in power consumption between the \gls{golden} and \gls{target} devices performing the same operations were recorded. Differences were used to discern the presence of a trojan.
	\item Bitfile Analysis: The authors attempted to employ a binary file analysis library named \textit{deBit}~\cite{bitStreamToNetlist} to reverse engineer a netlist from the \gls{Bitstream}.
\end{itemize}
The functional testing method attempted provided reasonable results. 
Test vectors showed unexpected behavior; this provided only the information that trojan was present, no details.
The power analysis method again provided results of moderate quality.
With careful placement of the oscilloscope probes the authors were able to infer the physical location on the device where modifications occurred.
This provided no information however as to the relation between the modifications and the design.
Finally, the authors were able to partially convert the \gls{Bitstream} to its netlist description.
Only descriptions of the primary logic circuit elements were acheived.
This could be used to discern some information regarding any modifications discovered but is far from creating a complete description of a trojan.
